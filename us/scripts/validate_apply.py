"""Post-apply lost-content validator.

Runs AFTER `apply_translations_textmatch.py` (and optionally after
`strip_noop_tracked_changes.py` + `post_process.py`) and compares the
translation declared in `paragraphs.json` (fields `en`, `en_deleted`,
`en_segments`) against what actually landed in the translated `document.xml`.

The check catches the "clause 5 dropped dates" class of defect, where a
translator wrote e.g.

    {"en_segments": [
      {"type": "regular", "en": "shall commence on "},
      {"type": "ins", "en": "[1 May 2020]"},
      {"type": "regular", "en": ". The road use fee ..."}
    ]}

but the produced document.xml ends up reading `shall commence on []. The road
use fee ...` — the bracket-contained date tokens were lost during text
distribution.

Implementation strategy:

1. Load `paragraphs.json`. For each paragraph with a non-empty `en`,
   `en_deleted`, or `en_segments`, build a set of "required tokens" — all
   words and dates of length >= 3 that the translator declared.
2. Parse the translated `document.xml`. For each paragraph, extract its
   combined text (both `<w:t>` and `<w:delText>`).
3. Compare per-paragraph: flag any required token that does not appear in
   the applied output.

The default run is advisory — the script prints a summary and any missing
tokens, and returns exit code 0. Pass `--strict` to return non-zero on any
miss, which blocks repack.

# token because it allows internal periods (needed for
# ``S.p.A.``, ``art.1234``, ``v.2.3``, ``1234.50``). The applied XML
# keeps the two segments as adjacent ``<w:t>`` runs ``"project."``
# and ``"hereinafter"``; tokenizing the joined element-text gives the
# same one-token result, but only because the runs happen to abut
# directly — once ``fix_spacing`` or ``strip_noop`` mutates the XML
# (inserting a space, or removing the phantom wrapper entirely), the
# applied side splits and the declared side does not. The result is a
# false-positive ``"project.hereinafter is missing"`` at the repack
# gate.

# The rule that distinguishes a sentence-boundary period from an
# abbreviation period is the *length of the lowercase run preceding
# the period*. ``S.p.A.``, ``i.e.``, ``e.g.``, ``a.m.``, ``p.m.``,
# ``S.r.l.`` all have 1-letter runs before each period (or an
# uppercase letter, which the lookbehind doesn't match). Sentence
# ends like ``project.hereinafter``, ``terminated.thereafter`` have
# 2+ lowercase letters preceding the period. Splitting on
# 2+-lowercase + ``.`` + lowercase preserves every legitimate Latin
# abbreviation pattern while breaking the phantom-glue case.
#
# Implemented as a pre-tokenize normalization rather than a regex
# change so that the abbreviation token shape (``S.p.A``, ``v.2.3``,
# ``1234.50``) is preserved exactly as in . The substitution

    When the paragraph is represented by ``en_segments`` (one segment per

    segments are joined before tokenizing. Otherwise a word that straddles
    a segment boundary produces fragmented required tokens that will never
    appear in the concatenated applied output — a false positive.

    Examples of the failure mode we are avoiding:

      * A word like ``direction`` split by a ``w:commentReference`` into
        two w:t runs reads as one segment ``dir`` followed by one segment
        ``ection``. Tokenizing each segment separately declares ``dir``
        and ``ection`` as required; the applied output has ``direction``;
        neither fragment matches.
      * A hyphenated compound like ``XY-coordinate`` split across an
        ``ins``/``del`` boundary reads as segments ``XY-`` and
        ``coordinate``. After per-segment stripping of trailing
        punctuation the required tokens become ``xy`` and ``coordinate``,
        neither of which matches ``xy-coordinate`` in the applied output.

    Concatenating the segments first makes the check see the same text
    the reader sees. This is a fix to what the validator *sees*, not a
    relaxation of what it requires.

    ORTHO-COLLAPSE: a (del, ins) pair with identical stripped English
    text is collapsed to a single copy before concatenation. Otherwise
    [del: "in particular"][ins: "in particular"] joins to
    ``in particularin particular`` and tokenizes to include

    ``extract_paragraphs`` flagged this paragraph as having 2+ adjacent
    <w:ins> / <w:del> wrappers. The defect class is the "PS → P S"
    seam-split. Route to the Scrambled-whole-word-edits fix.

    Pattern 2: ortho-collapse phantom.
    A word like ``particularin`` is flagged missing even though ``in``
    and ``particular`` both appear. This smells like a (del, ins) pair
    with identical English text where _collect_required_tokens was
    still double-counting. This indicates a latent bug if it still
    appears after Lever 2 lands.

    Pattern 3: short upper-case acronym missing.
    Tokens that are all uppercase and short (2-4 chars, e.g. ``USA``,
    ``VAT``) are typically protected by digit/alpha rules but can still
    be lost when the surrounding XML is heavily fragmented.
