"""Validate the *shape* of filled `en_segments` before apply runs.

Runs BEFORE `apply_translations_textmatch.py`, at the same point in the
pipeline as `validate_translations.py` and `validate_reject_all.py`.

============================================================================
WHY THIS EXISTS
============================================================================

`validate_reject_all.py` reconstructs the two views of a tracked-change
paragraph and scans them for grammar defects ("the respective the",
"to.Schedule", etc.). That catches the problem after it has already been
baked into a reconstruction — which still leaves the translator to work
out *which* segment caused it.

This script runs one level earlier. It scans `en_segments` pair-wise, at
the segment-boundary level, and warns about the shapes of splits that
**predict** downstream defects:

  * a regular segment ending with an English article/preposition abutting
    an ins/del that starts with a noun — double-article / stranded
    preposition risk;
  * a segment ending with an alpha character abutting the next segment
    starting with an alpha character, with no intervening whitespace —
    the gotcha for non-Latin script sources (Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
    Thai, Lao, Khmer, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, etc.),
    which either carry no inter-segment whitespace at all or whose
    character classes interact unpredictably with `fix_spacing`;
  * a digit sitting at a TC boundary — guarantees an alpha+digit
    collision in one of the two views;
  * an adjacent pair where both sides start or end with the same short
    article — means one view will read "the the" / "a a";
  * a double-space straddling a boundary;
  * an ins or del whose entire content is a bare article, preposition,
    or punctuation token (suggests the translator put a single function
    word on the TC side instead of on the regular side or vice versa —
    often diagnosable as an author's intent problem);
  * a lowercase word (2+ chars) directly followed by a digit inside one
    segment — e.g. "of500" / "section5" (digit glued to a word with no
    space); 2-char minimum excludes single-letter cross-refs ("a5.2",
    "e3") which are legitimate shorthand;
  * a digit directly followed by a 3+-char lowercase run inside one
    segment — e.g. "5minutes" / "500euros"; 3-char minimum excludes
    ordinals ("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th", "21st") and short unit
    abbreviations ("5km", "10kg", "500ml", "24h") without a whitelist.

The rules are intentionally conservative: every rule is backed by a
real defect observed in production. A paragraph that lints clean here is
not guaranteed to read well (that is what `validate_reject_all.py` is
for), but a paragraph that lints dirty here has a *shape* defect and the
translator can resolve it by rewriting the split — without re-running
the apply step and re-opening the .docx.
